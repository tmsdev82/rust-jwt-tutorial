# Rust JWT tutorial

This code repository shows a basic example of how to use the jsonwebtoken Rust crate.

It shows encoding, decoding and validation of a token with simple claims.

There is an article on my blog explaining the details of this example: [How to use JWT with Rust: learn the basics here](https://tms-dev-blog.com/how-to-use-jwt-with-rust-learn-the-basics/).

## Install & Run

Simply run the project using cargo:

```bash
cargo run
```

The output should be token information.
